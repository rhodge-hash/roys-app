# Feature Specification: Mobile-First Responsive PWA

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-mobile`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a mobile-first, responsive Progressive Web App named "Roys App." The app should use the provided logo as a favicon and be installable. The main view should display the content of the `contrib.md` file in a visually stunning layout, optimized for both mobile and desktop screens. The content of `contrib.md` will be static."

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to open Roys App on my device, whether it's a mobile phone or a desktop computer, and see the content of `contrib.md` displayed in a beautiful and easy-to-read format. I also want to be able to install the app on my device for easy access.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user with a modern web browser on a mobile device, **When** they navigate to the app's URL, **Then** the app should render a mobile-optimized view of the `contrib.md` content.
2. **Given** a user with a modern web browser on a desktop computer, **When** they navigate to the app's URL, **Then** the app should render a desktop-optimized view of the `contrib.md` content.
3. **Given** a user with a supported browser, **When** they visit the app, **Then** they should be prompted to install the app as a PWA.
4. **Given** the app is installed, **When** the user opens it, **Then** it should display the `contrib.md` content without a browser address bar.
5. **Given** any user, **When** they look at the browser tab or the app icon, **Then** they should see the Roys App logo as the favicon/icon.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when `contrib.md` is empty or not found? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the app display an error message, or a blank page?]
- How does the system handle browsers that do not support PWAs? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a fallback experience?]
- What is the expected appearance of the "visually stunning layout"? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there any design mockups, wireframes, or specific aesthetic guidelines to follow?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The application MUST be a Progressive Web App (PWA).
- **FR-002**: The application MUST be named "Roys App".
- **FR-003**: The application MUST use the provided logo as a favicon. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Where is the logo file located?]
- **FR-004**: The application MUST be installable on supported devices.
- **FR-005**: The main view MUST display the content of the `contrib.md` file.
- **FR-006**: The layout MUST be responsive and optimized for both mobile and desktop screens.
- **FR-007**: The content of `contrib.md` is considered static; the app only needs to display it.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Content Source**: Represents the `contrib.md` file, which is the single source of data for the application.
