## Testing Framework

*   **Decision**: Jest
*   **Rationale**: Jest is a widely used testing framework with a "zero-configuration" setup, built-in assertions, and mocking capabilities. It's suitable for vanilla JavaScript projects and provides a comprehensive testing solution out of the box.
*   **Alternatives considered**: Mocha, Jasmine.

## Unresolved Issues from `spec.md`

*   **Logo file location**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Where is the logo file located?]
*   **"Visually stunning layout"**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there any design mockups, wireframes, or specific aesthetic guidelines to follow?]
*   **`contrib.md` not found handling**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the app display an error message, or a blank page?]
*   **Fallback for non-PWA browsers**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a fallback experience?]
