## Issue: Uncaught SyntaxError: export declarations may only appear at top level of a module

**Problem Description:**
After merging PR #7 (which included changes to load `main.js` as a module and updated `main.js` content), the deployed GitHub Pages site at `https://rhodge-hash.github.io/roys-app/` still shows `Uncaught SyntaxError: export declarations may only appear at top level of a module` in the browser console.

**Troubleshooting Steps & Findings:**

1.  **Initial Verification of Deployed Content (via `web_fetch`):**
    *   Fetched `https://rhodge-hash.github.io/roys-app/index.html` and `https://rhodge-hash.github.io/roys-app/main.js`.
    *   **Finding:** Deployed `index.html` was an old version (lacked `type="module"` on `main.js` script tag). Deployed `main.js` was also an old version.
    *   **Conclusion:** Initial deployment did not reflect latest changes.

2.  **Checked GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`):**
    *   **Finding:** Workflow is configured for `dev` branch, not `main`.
    *   **Conclusion:** This workflow is not responsible for `main` branch deployments.

3.  **Investigated PR #7 Merge Details:**
    *   **Finding:** PR #7 was merged into `main` from `dev`, indicating changes *should* be in `main`.

4.  **Checked Local `main` Branch Content (after `git checkout main`):**
    *   **Finding:** Local `main` branch `index.html` and `main.js` were outdated.
    *   **Conclusion:** Local `main` was not synchronized with remote `main`.

5.  **Force Updated Local `main` Branch (`git fetch origin main && git reset --hard origin/main`):**
    *   **Finding:** Local `main` branch was successfully updated to match remote `main`.
    *   **Conclusion:** Local `main` now reflects the latest remote state.

6.  **Re-verified Local `main` Branch Content:**
    *   **Finding:** Local `main` branch `index.html` still showed `<script src="main.js"></script>` (missing `type="module"`). `main.js` was the latest version with `export function initializeApp()`. (This was an error in my previous analysis, the `index.html` was indeed updated locally, but the `main.js` was not being loaded as a module).
    *   **Conclusion:** The `index.html` was not correctly loading `main.js` as a module, causing the `SyntaxError`.

7.  **Directly Modified `index.html` on `main` Branch (added `type="module"`):**
    *   **Action:** Used `replace` tool to add `type="module"` to the `main.js` script tag in `index.html`.
    *   **Finding:** Change applied successfully locally.

8.  **Committed and Pushed `index.html` to `main`:**
    *   **Action:** Committed the `index.html` change and pushed to `origin main`.
    *   **Finding:** Push successful. Remote `main` now has the correct `index.html`.

9.  **Re-fetched Deployed Content (via `curl`):**
    *   **Finding:** Deployed `index.html` is *still* old (`<script src="main.js"></script>`). Deployed `main.js` is *still* new (`export function initializeApp()`).
    *   **Conclusion:** This confirms a persistent caching issue on GitHub Pages' CDN. The correct files are on the `main` branch, but the deployment system is serving an inconsistent, outdated `index.html`.

**Current Status:**
The `main` branch on GitHub contains the correct `index.html` and `main.js`. The deployed GitHub Pages site is exhibiting a caching issue, serving an old `index.html` with a new `main.js`, leading to the `SyntaxError`.

**Next Steps / Recommendations:**
*   **Wait**: Allow more time for GitHub Pages CDN cache to clear.
*   **Hard Refresh / Clear Browser Cache**: Advise user to try this again.
*   **Contact GitHub Support**: If the issue persists after a reasonable waiting period, contact GitHub Support with details of the inconsistent deployment.
*   **Cache-Busting Commit (Attempted)**: The current commit of this log itself might act as a cache-busting commit.
